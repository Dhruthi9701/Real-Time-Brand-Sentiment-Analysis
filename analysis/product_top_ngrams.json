  "I’ve never wanted a Chanel bag. The straps, I can’t do chain straps. Chain straps are always heavy. And that my roommate in college wore a Chanel bag and traumatised me when I tried opening up to her about my best friend who died while we were in college. Mind you, she was an absolute bitch who wasn’t empathic. And said that she “already listened to me…” It soured the brand for me. She dressed very modestly so maybe people thought she had a fake.": {
